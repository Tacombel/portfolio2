WORK IN PROGRESS

Work inspired by this great tutorial https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

Financial portfolio manager for small investors.

As I couldn't find any free finantial API, I scrape data from several sources, what makes the system not-user-friendly, but not too difficult to use.

Developed with Flask.

The code is heavily customized to my particular needs, so it is better suited for ideas rather than using it directly.
